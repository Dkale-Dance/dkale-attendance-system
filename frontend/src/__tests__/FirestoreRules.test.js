/**
 * FirestoreRules.test.js
 * 
 * This file contains tests for Firestore security rules.
 * It provides a structure for validating security rules, but the actual test
 * execution requires Firebase Emulator and would be run locally or in CI.
 * 
 * To run these tests, you would need to:
 * 1. Set up Firebase Emulator Suite
 * 2. Add firebase-admin and @firebase/rules-unit-testing packages
 * 3. Implement the actual security rules in a firestore.rules file
 * 
 * This test file serves as a template and documentation for the security rules
 * that should be implemented.
